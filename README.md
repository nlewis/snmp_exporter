# Prometheus SNMP Exporter

This is an exporter that exposes information gathered from SNMP
for use by the Prometheus monitoring system.

## Installation

```Shell
pip install snmp_exporter
```

You may need to also install the `python-dev` package on Debian/Ubuntu systems,
as some dependencies require it.

## Usage

```
snmp_exporter config_file [port]
```

`config` contains what OIDs to scrape and how to process them, see examples
in the `example_configs` directory. `port` defaults to 9116.

Visit http://localhost:9116/metrics?address=1.2.3.4 where 1.2.3.4 is the IP of the
SNMP device to get metrics from.

By default, snmp_exporter uses port 161 to connect to SNMP devices. This can be
overridden using either of these methods:

http://localhost:9116/metrics?address=1.2.3.4&port=123
http://localhost:9116/metrics?address=1.2.3.4:123

## Prometheus Configuration

The snmp exporter needs to be passed the address as a parameter, this can be
done with relabelling.

Example config:
```YAML
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'snmp'
    target_groups:
      - targets:
        - 192.168.1.2  # SNMP device.
    relabel_configs:
      - source_labels: [__address__]
        regex: (.*)(:80)?
        target_label: __param_address
        replacement: ${1}
      - source_labels: [__param_address]
        regex: (.*)
        target_label: instance
        replacement: ${1}
      - source_labels: []
        regex: .*
        target_label: __address__
        replacement: 127.0.0.1:9116  # SNMP exporter.
```

This setup allows Prometheus to provide scheduling and service discovery, as
unlike all other exporters running an exporter on the machine from which we are
getting the metrics from is not possible.

## Design

There are two components. An exporter that does the actual scraping,
and a generator that creates the configuration for use by the exporter.
Only the exporter is written so far.

This is to allow for customisation of what's done during the scrape as many
special cases are expected.  The varying levels of SNMP MIB-parsing support
across different langauges also means that a single language may not be
practical.
